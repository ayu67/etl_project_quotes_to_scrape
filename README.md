# etl_project_quotes_to_scrape

In this project, we practice web scraping and ETL using the website https://quotes.toscrape.com/

We first scrape all quotes and then load to MongoDB. Afterwards, we practice using python to extract the data from MongoDB as well as create tables to load into Postgres.

Finally, our goal is to create a Flask API using the views we have created.
